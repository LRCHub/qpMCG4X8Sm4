They killed you but not unfamiliar
Story that we're living through
As good observers that we were
Had to admit to the absurd nature
Of the advance which we're leaving the sin
The deepest uncertainty as to how things would unfurl
The way things would go
Which side I'd veer to
Which shape they would finally reach before changing again
Our hands were very small
The adjustments ahead to be made call us all
Though proud of our current accomplishments
There is always a bigger mountain to climb

And ours had run its course
Had run its course

In the
Keeping the compass to the center

To

Eternity
