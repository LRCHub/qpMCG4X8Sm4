Ooh (some kids have and some kids don't)
Ooh (we need some help)
Some kids have and some kids don't
And some of us are wondering why
And Mom won't watch the news at night
To much stuff that's making her cry
We need some help (some help)
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words (a million)
But one voice was heard
A house, a yard, a neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kinda world where mom and dad
Still believe the golden rule
Life's not that simple
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words (a million)
But one voice was heard
One voice
One simple word (one simple word)
Hearts know what to say
(Oh, one dream) one dream can change the world (can change the world
Keep believing 'til you find your way
Yesterday while walking home
I saw a kid on Newbury Road
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below
Thanks for the help (the help) down here on earth (down here on earth)
A thousand prayers, a million words (a million)
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard
Do do do, do do do
Ba da da da da da, ooh (whoa)
